# Moduel-2-Project

## Description
The challged asked to refactor the code. At first glance, everything seems good and does not require work. Once I looked deeply into the CSS and HTML code, I noticed there were a lot of repetions in the CSS code. Managed to combine a majority of them to hlep the flow of the page. 

I also changed the title and name of the company to better get across the purpose of the page.
